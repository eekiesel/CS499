# Artifact Selection
The capstone project for the Computer Science program at SNHU was required to demonstrate my skills in the three key categories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. I chose to select one artifact that I could work with to show my skills in all three categories. I chose to work with the weight tracking Android application that I origninally developed in CS 360: Mobile architecture in Programming that I took in Fall 2024. This was a very basic weight tracking application developed in Android Studio. It allowed users to log in, track their weight, set a goal weight, and edit and delete entries using a local SQLite database. 

# Code Review
Below is a link to a video of a code review of the original application as it was at the beginning of the class with planned enhancements. You can see a walkthrough of the app early in the video and it's clear how basic the fuctionality of the application is.
